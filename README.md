# Book Recommendations System using Python

This is a book recommendations system built using Python. The system is designed to use both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend books to users. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about books, including their titles, authors, genres, and user ratings. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k).

## Hybrid Filtering

The book recommendations system uses a hybrid filtering approach that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Content-based filtering recommends books to users based on the similarity between the books they have previously liked and the books in the dataset. Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, recommends books based on the ratings and preferences of similar users.

## Web Development

The book recommendations system has been integrated into a web application using HTML and CSS for the frontend. The web application allows users to browse and search for books, as well as view book recommendations based on their preferences.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to install Python and the necessary libraries, including Pandas and Scikit-learn. You will also need to download the dataset from Kaggle and extract the files.

## Conclusion

The book recommendations system is an example of how machine learning algorithms can be used to provide personalized recommendations to users. By combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques, the system is able to provide more accurate and relevant recommendations. The web application provides an easy-to-use interface for users to browse and discover new books based on their preferences.
